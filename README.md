# Imgur Clop Compilation

This is the Imgur Clop Compilation (ICC), a repository of
MLP:FiM porn comprised of many imgur albums uploaded by
various authors. The content is organized in folders by
common themes like characters or fetishes.

By default, deduplication is performed to reduce the
number of extra files that would otherwise increase archive
download size. File suffix correction is also performed for
sensitive image viewers like Eye of GNOME.

Since albums can get larger over time as new content is
added, this collection comes with a shell script to
synchronize with albums online, but it will only work in
Unix-like systems like GNU/Linux or environments like Cygwin
for Windows. Even if the script is not able to run, it will
not impede on the ability to view files that come in each
release of the ICC. Code for the script is publicly available
if you want to benefit from new features and bugfixes. You
can also submit feature requests and bug reports.
